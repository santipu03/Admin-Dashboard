# Admin-Dashboard
Dashboard design with HTML and CSS.
The website is not responsive yet but the project cards columns change depending on the width of the container without Media Queries, thanks to CSS Grid. The content is kind of fun so take a look at it. No offense with Elon Musk or anyone, I'm doing this only for fun. All suggestions are welcomed, I'm learning every day.
